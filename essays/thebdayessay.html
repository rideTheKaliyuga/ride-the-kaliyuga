      <h2>The Birthday Essay</h2>
      <div class="meta">By Harsh Patel | Published: January 26, 2025</div>
      <p>
        Imagine that I have a time machine. I have an important message to deliver and so I just time travelled to the morning of YOUR birthdate. But which year? All of them. So you are there and I am there and I deliver my message:<br>
        Dear [say your name], I wish you a very Happy Birthday! And whoosh, I go back. You might wonder what just happened and what any of this means. We have to go back to the story of why I took this trip and it begins with the following thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        General consensus is that birthdays are a form of celebration. Ok, so tell me what is there to celebrate. Getting a year closer to my death? Or the anniversary of the earth's rotation around the sun since my birth? Maybe it is not a "celebration". Maybe it need not be an "event". Maybe it is just another day. But then there are these other questions which pop up if that's true. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder, why do we ask other people about their birthday? Why do we try and remember and wish our close ones on their birthday? Why is there a birthday cake flavored ice cream? Fudge, why is there a birthday cake in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well because I think birthdays are a celebration. I think birthdays are a celebration of "YOU" as a person. It essentially symbolizes one simple yet very important thing: "YOU MATTER; you are celebrated". Unlike other celebrations like achieving a goal or getting a degree or winning a trophy; a birthday does not have a directly visible reason to celebrate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason to celebrate all of these other events is that there is a large external achievement (degree, trophy, etc.) associated with the internal achievement of growth (new learning, skill improvement, etc.). But the reason why a birthday should be celebrated is flipped on its head. We don't see it and so we don't celebrate.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what exactly is the reason to celebrate a birthday? It's this: "I matter and so I shall be celebrated." Sounds a bit selfish, right? Well that is why a birthday celebration is where others give you a gift, get you a cake, do things for you. Everything can be how you would like to be. To tell you that YOU MATTER! You matter to yourself and you matter to others. And we should all celebrate that. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now one might not care to celebrate with people (and for good reason) but this is one thing that I want to tell anyone who is reading this:<br>
        YOU MUST CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY because YOU MATTER.<br>
        And it starts with having the belief that you do. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Celebrate: by yourself or with loved ones, in the sunshine or under the moon. <br>
        Tell yourself that you matter by celebrating your birthday. And your belief will show you that you actually do. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Scheduling a "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" (because that time machine is still a work in progress) to the reader on their upcoming birthday :)
