      <h2>Do you MEAN what I UNDERSTAND?</h2>
      <div class="meta">By Harsh Patel | Published: April 26, 2025</div>
      <p>
        Think about all of the different circumstances in your life when you hear: “Communication is key!” Team sports, relationships, workplace; the list can go on and on. Any situation where you want to collaborate with someone, communication is the medium you need to use. And so we evolved ways of expressing our thoughts to someone else using language and gestures and symbols and what not. Allow me to use one of these mediums (language; and specifically writing) to share an intriguing thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        What are we trying to achieve when we communicate with someone about anything? I believe that we are trying to express our <b>meaning</b> to help someone's <b>understanding</b> about the aforementioned thing. Do you understand what I mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a general idea when it comes to the following words: meaning and understanding. We use them all the time and we know what’s what. “I think there is a misunderstanding here.”, “... Is that what you mean?”, “As far as I understand …” are all commonly used phrases in our day to day communication. But did you notice one common thing about our use of meaning and understanding? Meaning originates in the mind of the sender. Understanding happens in the mind of the receiver. That is the key; the key within communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        So how does my meaning become your understanding? Well a lot of things need to combine to facilitate this. We most commonly need language. We also need context to describe some things. We may need shared experiences to describe others. Take the example of someone using the word “apple”. Did you mean the fruit or the company? If I didn’t know about the company, I would just understand that you are talking about the fruit. Suddenly you say “I ate an apple” and even if I knew about the company, I know you are talking about the fruit. You don’t eat iPhones for lunch, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        While we need a lot of things to promote the conversion of meaning to understanding, one of the most important tools we use are definitions. Definitions allow for new understanding to arise from existing terms whose meaning one already knows. If we talk about definitions by themselves, no people involved, no communication involved; definitions express the absolute meaning of the term that is being defined. As soon as I am involved, my mind has its own meaning of the term. As soon as I try to communicate that with you, it can help you build your understanding of the term. Eventually, you develop your own meaning of the term.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that my mind and your mind are two separate entities. My meaning is mine and your meaning is yours. They can not be connected in any way. But if my meaning and your understanding are the same, the communication is effective. The closer the meaning in my mind and your mind aligns with the absolute meaning of the term, the more beautiful, true, and deeply connecting our communication becomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a simple yet powerful idea to keep in mind. We must remind our subconscious of it whenever it slips away. Let us strive to understand each other more deeply - to truly share the meaning behind our words. And perhaps one day, you will be able to ask someone: "Do you mean what I understand?"
